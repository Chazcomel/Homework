## Overview and Origin

Clearco - formerly Clearbanc  
Incorporated 2015  

Founders:  Andrew D'Souza (CEO) and Michelle Romanow (President)  

### Founding Story    


Michelle Romanow is the youngest member of the Canadian reality show "The Dragon's Den".  A serial entrepreneur, she started her first business in 2006 while studying at Queen's University and went on to found an additional four companies prior to turning 33 years old. She bootstrapped all of her companies prior to Clearbanc (now Clearco).  
* A Coffee Shop (First company while in University)
* Evandale Caviar (Vertically Integrated Fishery selling high end Caviar to hotels and restaurants)
* Buytopia.ca (2.5 Million Subscribers as of 2013)
* SnapSaves (Mobile Couponing Application, acquired by Groupon in 2014)  
* Clearbanc (2015) 

Andre D'Souza met Michelle and helped her raise money for the new venture.  They became partners in life and co-founders of Clearbanc.  His background includes raising hundreds of millions in VC as well as investing and advising startups.  

Clearbanc was founded as a venture capital firm formed when Michelle was frustrated funding and launching Buytopia.ca.  Traditional bank financing required assets as collateral and venture capital diluted her ownership.  The end result was slower growth by using self-funding. Partly through meeting Andre D'Souza, she was able to accurately value Buytopia.ca, sell the business and found Clearbanc with the proceeds.  

Recent funding includes $350M at a valuation of $2B.  This was a mixture of $100M in stock and the remaining amount as debt. 

### Business Activities - The Clearco way.

As mentioned previously, Clearco was founded to provide startups with a non-dilutive funding option.  To date, they have helped to fund 4,000 businesses through this model.  This allows a funded business to retain equity and agility in growth rather than being constrained by VC provided board members.  

Clearco offers a "pay as you grow" model.  Once funded, a company pays a set fee with no hard repayment deadlines.  This is typically done through 1-20% of sales or subscription revenue being paid to Clearco to payback the advance and fees.  Fees range from 6-12% of the amount funded.

A couple of years ago, Clearbanc (now Clearco) was primarily funding e-commerce companies who had regular monthly sales and needed marketing money to grow their business.  They offered a funding solution that was easy to apply to and funding in as little as 24 hours.  

Clearco launched a '20 Minute Term Sheet' campaign to prove to the market how quickly they could give access to capital.  This removes friction from the system.  Founders don't need to travel to various VC meetings, pitching their business ideas and negotiating due diligence.  Instead, Clearco has made the process much more efficient through technology.

Upon application for funds a business will give read-only access to Clearco to their systems, accounts and payment processing systems.  Clearco's system of using machine learning and AI allows Clearco to evaluate a business based on what they know about how successful the invesment is likely to be.  Risk is managed this way for Clearco and speed of decision is faster than other competitive funding strategies. 

Since founding, Clearco has started to apply it's automation to other industry verticals.  Additionally they claim that through machine learning and AI they are able to fund without the bias agains female-led or minority-led startups.  The data does the work through their proprietary systems.

## Venture Capital Landscape

Traditional VC trades equity for investement.  This typically is managed through several rounds (Series A,B,C etc.) funding with milestones, negotiated exits and board member addtions from the VC partners.  VC firms are able to offer funding to startups that traditional banks aren't able to help.  The VC firm will take on additional risk for the reward of an equity stake.

## Results

Clearco has funded more than 4,000 businesses with a higher percentage female-led approval than the larger VC market.

Through automation, machine learning and AI, Clearbanc is able to move quickly on a funding decision while allowing the founders of startups to retain equity and grow privately.  This provides flexibility for startups to gain scale and prepare for future funding events through traditional VC with better terms and more power.  

Clearco is focused on 'unit economics' in their funded companies.  By verifing unit profitability, Clearco removes the risk associated with a 6-12 month cash advance against sales.  Once a prospective company is able to get their accounts and systems connected to Clearco, a decision to fund or not usually happens within a few days or as short as 24 hours.

### Recommendations

Clearco is already starting to branch out from traditional e-commerce funding into other verticals.  This will spread their industry risk.  If they are able to train their systems to evaluate capital-intensive company funding needs efficiently, they should be able to earn a higher fee for the higher risk.  This effectively spreads the benefits of non-dilutive funding to other business types looking for VC and traditional bank alernatives.
